# The Jazz Scales App
Simple app for an aspiring jazz musician. It gives you:
- building scale from given note
- scale transposition in case you play a transposing instrument (trumpet, sax etc.)
- scales to improvise on, based on given chord (https://www.apassion4jazz.net/jazz-chords-scales.html)

The app is available at https://jazzscalesapp.azurewebsites.net. It takes a while to open. You can install it as PWA on your phone. Once installed, it can be used offline :)
